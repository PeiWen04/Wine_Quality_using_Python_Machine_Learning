# üç∑ Wine Quality Classification

This project aims to predict the quality of wine based on its physicochemical properties. Using the **Wine Quality dataset**, we classify wines as **Good** (quality ‚â• 6) or **Bad** (quality < 6) through various machine learning models such as **KNN**, **SVM**, and **Decision Tree**.

## üìÇ Dataset

**File:** `Winequality Data set.csv`
The dataset contains physicochemical attributes of wine samples such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol content, along with a quality score (0‚Äì10) rated by wine experts.

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| fixed acidity        | non-volatile acids in wine              |
| volatile acidity     | acetic acid content                     |
| citric acid          | citrus flavor compound                  |
| residual sugar       | amount of sugar left after fermentation |
| chlorides            | salt content                            |
| free sulfur dioxide  | SO‚ÇÇ in free form                        |
| total sulfur dioxide | total SO‚ÇÇ content                       |
| density              | relative density of wine                |
| pH                   | acidity level                           |
| sulphates            | SO‚ÇÇ to prevent oxidation                |
| alcohol              | alcohol percentage                      |
| quality              | quality score (0‚Äì10)                    |

## üßπ Data Processing

1. **Loaded dataset using Pandas**
2. **Handled duplicates and missing values**
3. **Converted wine quality into binary labels**

   * `1` ‚Üí Good wine (quality ‚â• 6)
   * `0` ‚Üí Bad wine (quality < 6)
4. **Performed feature scaling using StandardScaler**
5. **Split dataset into 70% training and 30% testing data**

---

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Generated **summary statistics** using `describe()`
* Visualized:

  * Histograms of features
  * Pairplots showing relationships
  * Correlation heatmap

## üîç Feature Selection

Used **ExtraTreesClassifier** to identify the most influential features.

**Top 5 Important Features:**

1. Alcohol
2. Sulphates
3. Volatile Acidity
4. Citric Acid
5. Total Sulfur Dioxide

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Place the dataset file (`Winequality Data set.csv`) in the same directory as `Wine quality.py`
2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python "Wine quality.py"
   ```
